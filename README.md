# Crochet Sim

A crochet-scheme design tool that simulates the actual yarn thread — folded
and intersected stitch by stitch in 3D — so a designer can check whether a
scheme is physically possible (and see roughly how it will look) before
spending time and yarn on a real trial.

Standalone web app: a Rust simulation/geometry core (compiled to WASM for
the browser) drives a Next.js/TypeScript UI with a 3D viewport. See
**[HANDOVER.md](./HANDOVER.md)** for architecture, the stack-choice
rationale, and current state. Goal and milestone tracking:
**[GOALS.md](./GOALS.md)**. Crochet domain reference (UK/GB terminology and
the construction rules the engine is built on): **[docs/crochet-context.md](./docs/crochet-context.md)**.

## Status

Just started — no code yet. See `GOALS.md` → G-001 for the milestone plan.

## Run locally

Not yet buildable. Setup instructions will be added here once M1 (core
engine scaffold) lands.
